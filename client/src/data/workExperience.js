                As a Functional Analyst, I played a key role within a small, agile team of fewer than ten members, delivering significant system overhauls, conducting API validation, and providing ongoing support for the LGY Customer Support platform, which serves over 10,000 users. My responsibilities were diverse and included gathering and defining development requirements based on client requests, performing front-end development to enhance the user interface, and contributing to security enhancements for custom-scripted Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality impacting our client base. Additionally, I assisted in the development and maintenance of workflows and data mappings across other LGY domains, including LoanSTAR and the Native American Direct Loan program.
